# Educational Heap Exploitation

This repo is for learning various heap exploitation techniques.
We came up with the idea during a hack meeting, and have implemented the following techniques:

Have a good example?
Add it here!
Try to inline the whole technique in a single `.c` -- it's a lot easier to learn that way.

# Heap Exploitation Tools

There are some heap exploitation tools floating around.

## shadow

jemalloc exploitation framework: https://github.com/CENSUS/shadow

## libheap

Examine the glibc heap in gdb: https://github.com/cloudburst/libheap

## Malloc Playground

The `malloc_playground.c` file given is the source for a program that prompts the user for commands to allocate and free memory interactively.

# Hardening
There are a couple of "hardening" measures embedded in glibc, like `export MALLOC_CHECK_=1` (enables some checks), `export MALLOC_PERTURB_=1` (data is overwritten), `export MALLOC_MMAP_THRESHOLD_=1` (always use mmap()), ...

More info: [mcheck()](http://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/Heap-Consistency-Checking.html), [mallopt()](http://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/Malloc-Tunable-Parameters.html).

There's also some tracing support as [mtrace()](http://manpages.ubuntu.com/mtrace), [malloc_stats()](http://manpages.ubuntu.com/malloc_stats), [malloc_info()](http://manpages.ubuntu.com/malloc_info), [memusage](http://manpages.ubuntu.com/memusage), and in other functions in this family.
