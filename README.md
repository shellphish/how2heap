# Educational Heap Exploitation

This repo is for learning various heap exploitation techniques.

The GnuLibc is under constant development and several of the techniques above have let to consistency checks introduced in the malloc/free logic.
Consequently, these checks regularly break some of the techniques and require adjustments to bypass them (if possible).
We address this issue by keeping multiple versions of the same technique for each Glibc-release that required an adjustment.
The structure is `glibc_<version>/technique.c`.

Have a good example?
Add it here!
Try to inline the whole technique in a single `.c` -- it's a lot easier to learn that way.

# Hardening
There are a couple of "hardening" measures embedded in glibc, like `export MALLOC_CHECK_=1` (enables some checks), `export MALLOC_PERTURB_=1` (data is overwritten), `export MALLOC_MMAP_THRESHOLD_=1` (always use mmap()), ...

More info: [mcheck()](http://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/Heap-Consistency-Checking.html), [mallopt()](http://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/Malloc-Tunable-Parameters.html).

There's also some tracing support as [mtrace()](http://manpages.ubuntu.com/mtrace), [malloc_stats()](http://manpages.ubuntu.com/malloc_stats), [malloc_info()](http://manpages.ubuntu.com/malloc_info), [memusage](http://manpages.ubuntu.com/memusage), and in other functions in this family.
